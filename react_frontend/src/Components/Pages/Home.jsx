    <h2>
      We want you to start loving <u>technical interview questions</u>
    </h2>
    <p>
      At ByteMe, we believe technical interview questions don't have to be
      intimidating â€” they can actually be exciting. Most people struggle because
      practicing alone feels overwhelming and repetitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's why we built a competitive 1v1 platform: to turn practice into a
      thrilling head-to-head challenge. Whether you're racing against friends,
      climbing the leaderboard, or just sharpening your skills, ByteMe
      transforms coding prep into something you'll actually look forward to.
